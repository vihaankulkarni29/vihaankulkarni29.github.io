                    <h2>My Origin Story</h2>
                    <p>
                      My journey into bioinformatics started with a lot of repetitive clicking. During my early work with bacterial genomics, I spent countless hours manually running bioinformatics tools, extracting sequences, and aligning them—again and again. While I loved the science, I realized that the time spent on these manual, repetitive tasks was time not spent on discovery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That realization sparked my passion for automation. I saw a huge opportunity to build tools that could handle the repetitive work, freeing up researchers to focus on the bigger questions. So, I taught myself Python and pipeline development to build the exact solutions I wished I had. Every project I create is born from a desire to solve a real-world bottleneck and help scientists get to their results faster.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why Antimicrobial Resistance?</h2>
                    <p>
                        AMR is projected to kill <strong>10 million people annually by 2050—more than cancer</strong>. Yet our ability to track and understand how bacteria develop resistance is painfully slow. Traditional lab methods take 3-5 days to identify a resistant infection. By then, patients have already received the wrong antibiotics and potentially spread the resistant strain to others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Computational genomics can change this timeline dramatically. <strong>We can identify resistance genes in hours instead of days</strong>, track how resistant strains spread across hospitals and regions, and predict which mutations are likely to emerge next. The technology exists. The sequencing capacity exists. What's missing are tools that work for everyone—not just bioinformaticians at well-funded institutions.
                    </p>
                    <h2>My Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>That's the gap I'm trying to fill.</strong> I build tools for the 90% of researchers who don't have computer science backgrounds, who work in resource-limited settings, who need answers fast and can't spend days debugging code. Clinical microbiologists running surveillance programs. Graduate students in labs without HPC clusters. Researchers in countries where AMR is already a daily crisis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we can democratize access to these analytical capabilities, we can build a truly global surveillance network for antimicrobial resistance. <strong>That's what drives me.</strong>

                  If you're working on AMR research and need computational support, building tools for clinical genomics, or developing surveillance infrastructure, <strong>I'd love to talk</strong>. I'm particularly interested in projects where the computational work directly enables better science or faster public health responses. I'm also happy to consult on pipeline development, tool design, or making existing workflows more efficient. Sometimes the best solution isn't building something new—it's fixing what already exists. <strong>Reach out if you think there's overlap:</strong>
