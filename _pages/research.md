# Research — Focus Areas

My research explores how protein-level changes drive antibiotic resistance and how reproducible computational workflows can accelerate discovery.

## AMR Comparative Genomics
I analyze AMR gene repertoires across environmental and clinical *E. coli* isolates. Key activities:
- Extracting AMR genes across isolates  
- Aligning proteins against a K-12 wild-type reference  
- Mapping substitutions and structural-context annotation

## Efflux Pump Structural Analysis (AcrAB–TolC)
I combine sequence variation with structural prediction to examine the functional consequences of mutations in efflux systems:
- Catalog mutations across isolates  
- Use structure prediction (where available) to hypothesize mechanistic effects  
- Prioritize mutations for experimental follow-up

## Mobile Elements: Integrons & IS Mapping
I map insertion sequences and integrons to reveal hotspots of gene movement and to understand how mobile elements mobilize AMR genes.

If you want specific figures, mutation maps, or slide-ready visuals on any of these topics, I can prepare a “Research Highlights” module that we can place on the homepage and link to a downloadable one-page dossier.
