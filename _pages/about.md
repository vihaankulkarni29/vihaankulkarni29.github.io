# About — Vihaan Kulkarni

**Decoding Biology with Code.** I build custom bioinformatics tools and AI-enhanced pipelines to accelerate research in antimicrobial resistance and computational genomics.

## The Spark
I’m a computational biologist who believes that careful software design and reproducible pipelines reveal deeper biological insight. My interest in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) began when I saw how slow, manual genomic workflows delayed actionable results. Since then, I’ve focused on automating the parts of research that hurt the most: extraction, alignment, and interpretable visualization.

## The Toolkit
I combine strong software engineering (Python, Biopython, Pandas) with domain knowledge in bacterial genomics. I use:
- Python & Biopython for sequence processing  
- EMBOSS-style alignment paradigms and custom parsers for reproducible comparisons  
- Structural prediction tools to connect sequence variation with protein function

My open-source toolkit includes FastAAExtractor, WildTypeAligner, and MetaAcrPipeline — each designed to scale from a handful of isolates to thousands of genomes.

## The Vision
My goal is to build predictive and reproducible computational frameworks that identify resistance-conferring changes before they become clinically dominant. I aim to make AMR analysis accessible through clean tools, clear documentation, and reproducible pipelines so research teams can focus on biological insights rather than brittle scripts.
