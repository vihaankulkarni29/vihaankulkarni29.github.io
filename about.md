Decoding the Microbial World, One Algorithm at a Time
As a computational biologist, I build bioinformatics tools that transform complex biological data into actionable insights—specifically targeting one of healthcare's most pressing challenges: antimicrobial resistance.

The Spark
My journey began with a simple question: Why do bacteria evolve resistance faster than we can develop new antibiotics? This question led me down a path where microbiology met data science, where wet lab observations transformed into computational predictions, and where understanding mutation patterns could potentially save lives.

The realization hit during my undergraduate studies—while researchers were documenting resistant strains after they emerged, we needed to predict these mutations before they happened. That's when I knew computational biology wasn't just an interest; it was where I needed to make my contribution.

The Toolkit
Over the past year, I've immersed myself in the intersection of genomics and software development. Working as a computational biologist, I've designed tools that process genomic data faster and extract more meaningful patterns from sequence information. Each tool addresses a specific bottleneck in antimicrobial resistance research—whether it's identifying resistance genes, tracking mutation pathways, or analyzing evolutionary patterns across bacterial populations.

My approach combines Python-based data pipelines with biological intuition. Technologies like Biopython and Pandas aren't just libraries to me—they're instruments for asking deeper questions about microbial evolution. When I read papers on resistance mechanisms, I'm simultaneously thinking: How can I build a tool that makes this research more scalable?

The work goes beyond code. Understanding why a single nucleotide substitution confers resistance to an entire class of antibiotics requires diving deep into structural biology, evolutionary dynamics, and biochemistry. That's where my passion truly lies—in the fundamental science behind the mutations themselves.

The Vision
My goal is to contribute to predictive frameworks that can identify resistance-conferring mutations within genomes before clinical resistance emerges. I'm particularly interested in how structural prediction tools like AlphaFold can enhance our understanding of how mutations alter protein function and confer resistance at the molecular level.

Currently seeking opportunities to collaborate on research that combines genomic analysis, machine learning, and structural biology to stay one step ahead of evolving pathogens. If your lab or organization is tackling antimicrobial resistance through computational approaches, I'd welcome the conversation.

Let's build tools that help us understand life's tiniest adversaries—before they outsmart our medicines.
